## Homework 1: Communication Protocols (Buzea Alexandru-Mihai-Iulian, 321CAb)

1. INTRODUCTION

    During this homework I was needed to implement the dataplane of a router,
based on the details given in the homework formulation. There were three main
protocols used together: **IPv4**, **ICMP** and **ARP**.

2. The main structure

    My code consists of a while(1) loop which is used to receive incoming
packages. All packages have an *Ethernet header* that is used to send the
packet (frame) at the Data Link level in the local network. Using this
header, we can find out which type of packet we have. In this homework,
the only types we were interested in were **IPv4** packets (some of them
being treated as **ICMP** packets) and **ARP** packets.

3. IPv4 and forwarding

    I used a static routing table (without implementing routing protocols
such as OSPF for dynamic routing) in which I stored entries (structs in C)
containing the prefix, mask, interface and the IP address of the next hop.
In order to determine the next hop's entry corresponding to the given IP
address of the destination (in the packet), I used the longest prefix match
algorithm together with binary search, in order to have a fast search, in
O(log n) complexity. As a prerequisite, I sorted the routing table ascending
with respect to the prefix (which is actually prefix & mask) and then after
mask (as a sorting criteria).

4. ARP reply and request

    I used a dynamic ARP table in order to store MAC address - IPv4 address
pairs in order to be used in the forwarding process. The table was filled
by receiving ARP replies made by other entities in the network to our requests.
Also, the router is capable of responding to ARP requests sent by other
entities.

5. ICMP

    The router is also able to respond and to send ICMP packets and errors
(Time Exceeded and Destination Unreachable error types). For example, if
the time-to-live of a packet has expired, the router sends an ICMP error
message (Time Exceeded type), or if the LPM algorithm gave no results
(no associated addresses with the given one in the routing table).

6. Using the last year's functions

    As a response to a colleague's question (during Communication Protocols
course), our professor told that, if we use functions from the last year's
skel, we shold mention that in the README and the comments. By this, I mean
that the functions used (send_icmp(), send_icmp_error() and send_arp()) were
***not*** written by myself and are not my property.
